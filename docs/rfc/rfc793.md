# Introduction

- TCP is a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to fit in a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network applications
- scope: process-to-process, host-to-host
- two sides of TCP: one side to user/application processes and on the other side to a lower level protocol like IP
- facilities required to provided service on top of a less reliable internet communication:
  - Basic Data Transfer
  - Reliability
  - Flow Control
  - Multiplexing
  - Connections
  - Precedence and Security
- a push method is defined for the purpose of making sure the submitted data to TCP has been transmitted(Basic Data Transfer)
- TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order(Reliability: sequence number/ACK for lost/duplicated, checksum for damaged)
- TCP provides a means for the receiver to govern the amount of data sent by the sender(Flow Control: by returning a window with every ACK)
- TCP allow for many processes within a single Host to use tcp simultaneously(Multiplexing: by socket)
- TCP must first establish a connection, initialize the status information on each side, and so comes a handshake mechanism with clock-based sequence numbers(Connections)
- TCP users may indicate the security and precedence of their communication(Precedence and Security)

# Philosophy

- TCP is assumed to be a module in an operating system, The users access the TCP much like they would access the file system
- Transmission is made reliable via the use of sequence numbers and acknowledgments
- to govern the flow of data between TCPs, a flow control mechanism is employed(window)
- a socket will be unique throughout all networks connected together
- a connection as fully specified by the pair of sockets at the ends
- two processes which issue active OPENs to each other at the same time will be correctly connected
- connection becomes established when sequence numbers have been synchronized in both directions
- tcp implementations will follow a general principle of robustness: be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others
